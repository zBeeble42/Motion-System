This modified version of E3D's toolchanger uses a more commonly found 24BYJ48 micro stepper motor with the two "ears".  The machined aluminium 'TC-BACK_1_1.sldprt' -> 'TC_BACK_1_2.sldprt' and the 3D printed 'Tool-Changer Cover Body.sldprt' -> 'Tool-Changer Cover Body_1.1.sldprt' parts have been modified to fit these motors.

I have not tested any motors with this new design, so use this at your own risk.
